# What's OpenAcademy? #

OpenAcademy is a program that sets current college students up with mentors and
projects in the open source community. In OpenAcademy's semester at Columbia
our students have worked all semester with teams around the world to bring fixes
and features to real open source projects. 

We had our final presentations on May 16 in the CS Lounge. Check out each group's page to learn more about their project and see their presentation.
