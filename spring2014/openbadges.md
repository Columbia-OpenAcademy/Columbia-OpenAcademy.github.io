Mozilla Open Badges makes it easy for anyone to issue, earn, and display badges across the web through a shared infrastructure that's free and open to all. Open Badges are transferable, stackable, evidence-based, and, of course, free and open source. Think of it as a persistent achievement system across multiple platforms.

Mozilla Persona is a simple, password-less sign-in system that only requires an existing email. Abstract the sign in pain away by letting Mozilla take care of the authentication.

This semester, Don Yu (@donyu) and Stephen Zhou (@stepzhou) integrated these Mozilla services as MediaWiki extensions, providing Open Badge and Persona functionality to wikis.
