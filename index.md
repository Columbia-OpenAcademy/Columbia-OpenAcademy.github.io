# What's OpenAcademy? #

OpenAcademy is a program that sets current college students up with mentors and
projects in the open source community. In OpenAcademy's first run at Columbia
our students have worked all semester with teams around the world to bring fixes
and features to real open source projects. Come by our presentation day to check
them out!

 - **When**: Wednesday May 14th, 11am-2pm
