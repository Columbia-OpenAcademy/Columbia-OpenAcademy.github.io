Socket.IO aims to make realtime apps possible in every browser and mobile device, blurring the differences between the different transport mechanisms. It's care-free realtime 100% in JavaScript.

This semester Kevin, Adam, and Brian worked on a few different projects for Socket.IO: adding binary support for Socket.IO v1.0, making a better assertion framework for testing, and adding Browserstack support for [Zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul). You can check out their final presentation [here](http://columbia-openacademy.github.io/presentations-spring2014/SocketIO.pdf).
