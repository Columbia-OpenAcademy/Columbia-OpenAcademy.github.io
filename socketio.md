Socket.IO aims to make realtime apps possible in every browser and mobile device, blurring the differences between the different transport mechanisms. It's care-free realtime 100% in JavaScript.

This semester Kevin, Adam, and Brian worked on a few different projects for Socket.IO:
* Adding binary support for Socket.IO v1.0
* Making a better assertion framework for testing
* Adding Browserstack support for [Zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul)
