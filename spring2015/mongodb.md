MongoDB reinvents data management and powering big data as the leading NoSQL database. It has a thriving global community with over 4 million downloads, 200,000 online education students, and 20,000 user group members.

This semester, Riaz Helfer (@Riaz1729), Brian Trippe (@blt2114), and Nitesh Menon (@nitesh201), paired with MongoDB's online education team ("MongoDB University"), were tasked with revamping the courseware for M101P, MongoDB University's introduction to building Mongo-backed web-apps in Python. In particular, the three set out to develop an online multiplayer "base defense" game backed by MongoDB and translate the game into a set of assignments alternative to the course's existing blog project. They hope that their implementation, which exposes many high-level features of MongoDB, serves as an exciting and relevant use case for MongoDB's inherent capacity to efficiently back large-scale projects.
