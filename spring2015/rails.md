Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework written in Ruby. It's a powerful, full stack framework that practices the MVC paradigm and is extremely popular to its quick bootstrapping, solid libraries/gem support, and Convention over Configuration utilization that results in the ability for Rails developers to quickly jump into any other Rails application codebase.

This semester, Hyonjee Joo, Ben Kogan, and James Wen worked on various bug fixes and small features for the upcoming 5.0.0 version release. Their main project was implementing the wrapping of all Postgres transaction database queries in savepoints and utilizing automatic rollbacks to prevent contaminated/unusable database connections after errors.
