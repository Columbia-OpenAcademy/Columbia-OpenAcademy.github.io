Eclipse Orion is a web based editor that takes advantage of the tools available in modern browsers to make development of web-based projects, particularly those using node.js, a breeze. Orion features a text editor with syntax highlighting, live preview of web pages, and access node.js functionality such as npm and node commands for in-browser development.

This is Eclipse Orion's second run in Open Academy. This semester, Albert (@albertcui) and Mei-Vern (@mvthen) worked primarily on the Node.js side of Orion. Orion's git features are functional in the Java server side of Orion, and need to be similarily implmemented on the Node side. They used the Javascript and the nodegit library to parse server routes and interact with git to finish the back end.
