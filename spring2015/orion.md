Eclipse Orion is a web based editor that takes advantage of the tools available in modern browsers to make development of web-based projects, particularly those using node.js, a breeze. Orion features a text editor with syntax highlighting, live preview of web pages, and access node.js functionality such as npm and node commands for in-browser development.

This is Eclipse Orion's second run in Open Academy. While the original Java server for Orion is fully featured, the newer Node.js server lacks feature parity. This semester, Albert (@albertcui) and Mei-Vern (@mvthen) worked primarily on porting over Orion's git funtionality and pages over to the Node.js server. They used NodeGit, a Javascript wrapper for libgit2, to provide git functionality and the implementation of Orion's server Git API.
