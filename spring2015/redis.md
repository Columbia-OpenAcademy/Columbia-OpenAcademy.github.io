title: Redis
layout: project
summary: Redis provides a base feature set from which a graph database engine can be built efficiently. Redis is a data-structure server, providing blazingly fast read/write speeds. It has mature support for asynchronous replication that forms the backbone of highly available and reliable systems. Benchmarks and some initial tests demonstrate that Redis is a good choice for such a graph search and analysis engine.
