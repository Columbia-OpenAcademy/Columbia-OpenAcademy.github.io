This semester, Hyonjee Joo, Ben Kogan, and James Wen worked on various bug fixes and small features for the upcoming 5.0.0 version release. Their main project was implementing the wrapping of all Postgres transaction database queries in savepoints and utilizing automatic rollbacks to prevent contaminated/unusable database connections after errors.
