KDevelop is a free, open source IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Linux, Mac OS X and other Unix flavors. It is a feature-full, plugin extensible IDE for C/C++, Ruby, Python, PHP and other programming languages.

Matthew Suozzo (@msuozzo) and Zuokun Yu (@zeekkr) added NVIDIA CUDA C/C++ support to the brand new parsing engine built on the LLVM Clang API. The goal is to standardize CUDA support with well supported languages such as C++. They worked on syntax highlighting, preliminary parser integration, and a few additional KDevelop quirks.
