Eclipse Orion is a web based editor that takes advantage of the tools available in modern browsers to make development of web-based projects, particularly those using node.js, a breeze. Eclipse features a text editor with syntax highlighting, live preview of web pages, and access node.js functionality such as npm and node commands for in-browser development.

This semester Jon, Kaitlin, and Melody worked on a few different aspects of Orion. They used term.js and socket.io to rip out the existing shell and replace it with a fully functional console that provides access to the same terminal your operating system would provide you with, in the browser. Jon spent some time working through the intricacies of git and Orion's pull request policy. Kaitlin did some work to make it possible to use `npm install -g orion` so you can have access to Orion wherever you work. Melody and Kaitlin worked together to add syntax highlighting for some missing languages to the text editor, too!
