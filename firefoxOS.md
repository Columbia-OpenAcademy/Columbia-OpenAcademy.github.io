 - Targeted to users of developing countries

What was our goal?
-----
Add a feature to the OS so that one can send applications to other devices over NFC and Bluetooth.

Why?
----
Currently only way to get apps is to download from Marketplace. But data is very expensive in developing countries. So provide an alternative way to get apps.
