OpenStack is a massively scalable cloud operating system, composed of numerous services. Our project was focused on two services, namely the Keystone authentication service, and the Horizon dashboard. Keystone controls the issuing of access tokens for the other services, and Horizon serves as a web interface for monitoring these services. We implemented two-factor authentication for Keystone, leveraging the Google Authenticator application, and built a front end to utilize these APIs.
